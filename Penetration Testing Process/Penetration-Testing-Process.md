# Penetration Testing Process

## Pre-Engagement
- **Scoping the Engagement**: Define the scope, rules of engagement (ROE), and legal agreements.
- **Information Gathering**: Collect publicly available information about the target (OSINT).
- **Contract and Legal Review**: Ensure all legal documentation is in place.

## Information Gathering
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gather information without directly interacting with the target.
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Directly interact with the target to gather information.
- **Network Scanning**: Use tools like Nmap to discover hosts and services.
- **Service Enumeration**: Identify versions and configurations of running services.

## Vulnerability Assessment
- **Automated Scanning**: Use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Testing**: Perform manual checks for complex vulnerabilities.
- **Web Application Testing**: Test for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- **Network Infrastructure Testing**: Test network devices and configurations.

## Exploitation
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrate that vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- **Gaining Initial Access**: Exploit vulnerabilities to gain a foothold in the target system.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Escalate privileges to gain higher-level access.
- **Lateral Movement**: Move through the network to access additional systems.

## Post-Exploitation
- **Persistence**: Establish persistent access to the compromised systems.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Extract sensitive data to demonstrate impact.
- **Evidence Collection**: Document all findings and evidence of compromise.
- **System Cleanup**: Remove artifacts and restore systems to original state.

## Reporting
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of findings for management.
- **Technical Details**: Detailed technical findings for IT teams.
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess the risk level of each finding.
- **Remediation Recommendations**: Provide specific steps to fix identified issues.
- **Timeline and Methodology**: Document the testing approach and timeline.

## Post-Engagement
- **Report Review**: Review the report with the client.
- **Remediation Support**: Assist with fixing identified vulnerabilities.
- **Re-testing**: Conduct follow-up testing to verify fixes.
- **Lessons Learned**: Document lessons learned for future engagements.

- Regularly updated with latest attack vectors

### NIST SP 800-115
- Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment
- Federal standard for penetration testing methodology
- Covers planning, discovery, attack, and reporting phases

### PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)
- Community-driven standard for penetration testing
- Provides detailed methodology for each phase of testing
- Includes technical guidelines and reporting standards

### OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
- Peer-reviewed methodology for security testing
- Focuses on operational security metrics
- Provides repeatable and consistent testing approach

## Best Practices

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Always obtain proper written authorization before testing
- Respect the scope and limitations defined in the engagement
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Maintain confidentiality of client information

### Documentation
- Keep detailed logs of all testing activities
- Take screenshots and collect evidence of findings
- Document the methodology used for each test
- Maintain chain of custody for any extracted data

### Communication
- Maintain regular communication with the client
- Report critical findings immediately
- Provide clear and actionable recommendations
- Be available for questions and clarifications during remediation
